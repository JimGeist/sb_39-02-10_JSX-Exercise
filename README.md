## Assignment Details

Assignment was composed of 3 parts designed to increase familiarity with `JSX` components.

**Part 1: 3 Components** involved creating an App component with a `<div>` containing instances of `FirstComponent` which returned an **h1** with text *My very first component* and an instance of `NamedComponent` which accepted a name property and returned a **p** with *My name is {props.name}*. 

**Part 2: Tweet** involved creating a component that resembled a tweet which accepted a user, username, date of tweet, and message. The App component rendered 3 tweets.

**Part 3: Person** involved creating a component named `Person` which includes logic to display different elements depending on the `age`, `name`, and `hobbies` properties.
